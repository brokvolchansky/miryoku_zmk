[Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/) is an ergonomic, minimal, orthogonal, and universal keyboard layout. 
[Miryoku ZMK](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku_zmk) is the Miryoku implementation for [ZMK](https://zmkfirmware.dev/).

See the [Miryoku ZMK Quickstart Guide](docs/quickstart) to have a personalised build running on your keyboard in a few minutes without installing any software or editing any files.

## This repo
is a clone of the Miryoku repository customized for my Chocofi keyboard by [Beekeeb](https://shop.beekeeb.com/product/chocofi-36-keys-kailh-low-profile-choc-v1-mechanical-ergonomic-hotswap-split-keyboard-diy-kit/).
It can be built locally as well as with help of github actions.

### The differences in the default settings I use are: 
- the default [layout](.github/workflows/anton.yml) changed to QWERTY;
- added Russian layer with helpers for Karabiner;
- added possibility to build it locally;
- nice-view module changed to [nice-view-gem](https://github.com/M165437/nice-view-gem).

Some [settings](config/corne.keymap) for russian layer you could find a bit weird — you are free to change them as you wish in your clone.

Also, see [instructions](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/discussions/71#discussioncomment-2108278) of how to change layer presentation you can find in the layout directory of the repo.

I appreciate [guys from Beekeeb.com](https://shop.beekeeb.com/contact/), [Manna Houbre](https://github.com/manna-harbour/manna-harbour/tree/main/contact) and [M165437](https://github.com/M165437) who did a lot of work to let me type on this device with pleasure!
